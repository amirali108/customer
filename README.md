Project Overview:

The project aims to automate the deployment process for customer environments, streamlining transitions to dedicated hardware and facilitating their conversion into paying customers. This documentation offers a detailed explanation of the project objectives, steps, and components involved in the deployment process.

Objectives:

1-Automated Configuration: Develop an automated configuration process for customer deployments to minimize manual intervention and streamline operations.

2-Enhanced Customer Experience: Simplify the deployment procedure to enhance customer experience, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition to dedicated hardware.

3-Smooth Migration: Enable smooth migration to dedicated hardware for customers, ensuring minimal disruption to their operations during the transition period.

4-Monetization: Facilitate the monetization of customer deployments by providing seamless access to services on dedicated hardware.

Components:

1-Automation Script: Utilize Ansible to create scripts that automate the deployment process, including software installation, web server configuration, and email notifications.

2-Customer Portals: Develop open-source portals similar to Hub.itsl for customer interaction, providing access to services and facilitating communication.

3-Email Notifications: Configure automated email notifications to inform customers about their deployed environments, ensuring transparency and timely updates.


Project Structure:

The Ansible project directory is structured as follows:

Each role directory contains a tasks subdirectory, which further organizes tasks based on their functionality. The main.yml files serve as entry points for the tasks within each directory, promoting modularity and maintainability.



Here's how to safely edit the /etc/sudoers file:
Open the /etc/sudoers File Safely: Use the visudo command, which ensures syntax checking and more safety than directly editing the file.Run:

sudo visudo              #till exp: server3@ubuntuserver3:~/customer$ sudo visudo

Add the Passwordless Sudo Entry: In the editor that opens, add the following line to grant server3 passwordless sudo privileges:

"user" ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL          #till exp: server3 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
