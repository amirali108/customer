Project Overview:

The project aims to automate the deployment process for customer environments, streamlining transitions to dedicated hardware and facilitating their conversion into paying customers. This documentation offers a detailed explanation of the project objectives, steps, and components involved in the deployment process.

Objectives:

1-Automated Configuration: Develop an automated configuration process for customer deployments to minimize manual intervention and streamline operations.

2-Enhanced Customer Experience: Simplify the deployment procedure to enhance customer experience, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition to dedicated hardware.

3-Smooth Migration: Enable smooth migration to dedicated hardware for customers, ensuring minimal disruption to their operations during the transition period.

4-Monetization: Facilitate the monetization of customer deployments by providing seamless access to services on dedicated hardware.

Components:

1-Automation Script: Utilize Ansible to create scripts that automate the deployment process, including software installation, web server configuration, and email notifications.

2-Customer Portals: Develop open-source portals similar to Hub.itsl for customer interaction, providing access to services and facilitating communication.

3-Email Notifications: Configure automated email notifications to inform customers about their deployed environments, ensuring transparency and timely updates.
